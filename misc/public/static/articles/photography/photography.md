# Cat

Cats are the ultimate skeptics. Leave the house for six hours, and when you return, they look at you like, ‘Oh, you again.’ Forget the fact that you pay the rent, provide the food, and scoop their poop—they’re convinced you exist solely as their underpaid butler. A dog will greet you at the door with wild enthusiasm, but a cat will sit in the doorway like a royal guard, judging your life choices. ‘Mail again? Pathetic,’ their eyes seem to say. And yet, despite their cold stares and aloofness, they’ll still curl up on your chest at 2 a.m., reminding you that you are, in fact, worthy... but only because it’s cold and they need body heat.

# Dog {#dogtag}

Dogs are the ultimate optimists. Leave the house for 30 seconds to check the mail, and when you return, they’ll act like you’ve been to war and back. ‘YOU’RE ALIVE!’ they seem to say, wiggling and wagging like you’re the sole reason they exist. Forget that you just scolded them for eating your socks; that’s old news in dog-time. For dogs, every moment is a party, and you’re always the guest of honor. If only humans could learn to celebrate each other’s presence with half as much enthusiasm. Minus the slobber, of course.
